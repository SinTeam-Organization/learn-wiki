As we are in these lab sessions, keep in mind how this work can integrate with other workstreams in terms of their automation.

# Session target format

- 30 min [max] walkthrough to provide an overview on how to achieve the objectives
- individual hands on and ask questions and collaborate
- screen share at the end on progress and learnings 

## Agenda

- Demo/walkthrough
- Objectives review
- Go do
- Screen share

Each person will select their own objective(s) to work on throughout the session. 

## Objectives

**Overall objective**
These objectives will be targeted towards getting AVD automated within a pipeline, but will not actually do the whole deployment. Each objective will not be dependent on one another and can be worked on independently. 

- Use Environments and environment variables and secrets to deploy to more than one different environments
- Create a manual check gate for a job
- Connect to an Azure environment and return a query result
- Create an issue, and link a change to the issue
- Create a repository with a branch rule requiring reviewers and a passing build to complete a Pull Request merge 
- Create a workflow to build, publish artifacts, and then download the artifacts
