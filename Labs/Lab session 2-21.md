As we are in these lab sessions, keep in mind how this work can integrate with other workstreams in terms of their automation.

# Session target format

- 30 min [max] walkthrough to provide an overview on how to achieve the objectives
- individual hands on and ask questions and collaborate
- screen share at the end on progress and learnings 

## Agenda

- Demo/walkthrough
- Objectives review
- Go do
- Screen share

Each person will select their own objective(s) to work on throughout the session. 

## Objectives

**Overall objective**

These objectives will be targeted towards getting AVD automated within a pipeline, but will not actually do the whole deployment. Each objective will not be dependent on one another and can be worked on independently. 

- Collaborate on the same repo with others, create a feature branch, make changes, create a Pull Request, and wait for a build to pass to complete the merge to _main_

### Walk through

- Create a CI build on push
- Protect a branch with required reviewers and CI build pass
- Branch and create a Pull Request
